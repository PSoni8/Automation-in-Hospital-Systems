# Automation in Hospital Systems
It is solution for Hospitals in which we tried to minimize human contact to avoid the spread of COVID-19 virus and also tried to
minimize the cost (approx. 6500-7000 rupees) so that small hospitals can also work on this solution. </br>
We built Automated model using Sensors, Arduino & 20 pin AT89C2051, Web Application for Online Appointment
using HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Php & OCR for Offline Registration using Python, OpenCV. </br>
